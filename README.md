# Engineer Data In Google Cloud

This exercise is part of my Data Engineering and Machine Learning Fundamental training provided by Google. ‘Engineer Data in Google Cloud Challenge Lab’ is a non-guided lab under the quest ‘Engineer Data in Google Cloud’ from Google Skills Boost. 

## Scenario

You have started a new role as a Data Engineer for TaxiCab Inc. You are expected to import some historical data to a working BigQuery dataset, and build a basic model that predicts fares based on information available when a new ride starts. Leadership is interested in building an app and estimating for users how much a ride will cost. The source data will be provided in your project.

## Challenge

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop you receive your first assignment: build a basic BQML fare prediction model for leadership. Perform the following tasks to import and clean the data, then build the model and perform batch predictions with new data so that leadership can review model performance and make a go/no-go decision on deploying the app functionality.
